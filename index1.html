      Follow me home, if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances
When no one took chances on me
So, I watch from the dark
Wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets
Alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something
Something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms
I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light, before the dawning
Out here the wild ones
Are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends
And be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets
Alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something
Something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms
I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
And so maybe my home
Isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive
With these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe
But it's wild and it's free
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets
Alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them I have something
Something to cling to
I never knew I'd love
This world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts

I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want

I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go

Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans

        Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train
        It was sunny
        Her saltbox house on the coast
        Took her mind off St. Louis
        Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
        And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
        The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
        There's only so far new money goes
        They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
        Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
        The doctor had told him to settle down
        It must have been her fault his heart gave out
        And they said
        "There goes the last great American dynasty"
        "Who knows if she never showed up, what could've been"
        "There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen"
        "She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything"
        Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set
        Forever
        Flew in all her ***** Pack friends from the city
        Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
        And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
        And losin' on card game bets with Dalí
